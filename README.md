# Fantastic Animated Vector Drawables And Where To Use Them
This repository contains the sample project used for my [talk](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/17WFY_MFIBkcuW1ouYcyI_haH6O7McnyTW3M_IirVMWE).

## Talk Abstract
I'll go over the basics of vector graphics, animations you could do with native android, and where you could use them in a material app.

Since Android 5.0, you can define Vector Drawables in their apps. The AnimatedVectorDrawable class was also introduced, which lets you animate properties on Vector Drawables.

I will assume that listeners have basic knowledge of Android programming. There will be code/assets shared on github, and people can follow along as I create a simple animation using the AnimatedVectorDrawable class. I will also demo some situations where an animated vector graphic can enhance user experience (specific to Android navigation patterns like ViewPagers, etc).
